                <p>
                    My name is Ann Smith. I am a senior in high school. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite subjects are chemistry and biology. I am going to enter the university because my goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected professional in one of the fields.
                    I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. 
                    I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. 
                    The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. 
                    I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
